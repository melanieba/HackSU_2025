# HackSU_2025
 
Inspiration
We wanted to specifically focus on mental health and make our application tailored to the user.

What it does
HawkMind is a mental health app designed for Seattle University students to track their emotions, reflect on their thoughts, and access personalized support. With HawkMind, students can log their mood by selecting how they feel and specifying their emotions. Based on their input, they receive tailored motivational quotes, journal prompts, and self-care tips to support their well-being. The app also provides access to SU mental health resources for additional support if needed. Over time, students can review their mood history and journal entries, helping them recognize patterns and personal growth. Whether it's a stressful exam week or a moment of self-reflection, HawkMind is here to support students in their mental wellness journey.

How we built it
We used SQLight to implement our database, Python and SQL to integrate it and interact with it. We used HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend.

Challenges we ran into
The biggest issue was with hosting the server due to a merge conflict.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having our website correctly interact with the database, such as when we choose a mood, later a random quote will be shown from the database that was associated with that mood!

What we learned
Everyone gained valuable skills from this end-to-end project. Some of us explored HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while others learned the workings of servers, databases, and website connectivity. Additionally, some gained experience with SQLite.

What's next for HawkMind
Making this into an app, as well as adding tips for each result page also tailored to what the user is feeling. These would be SU tailored, such as if a user is anxious, we will recommend walks they can take on campus or spots to sit and relax at.
